# Reordering Extension for VSCode

The Reordering extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to easily reorder function arguments and parameters.

## Features

- Reorder arguments to the left or right: Quickly move parameters within a function or block of code to the left or right, making it easier to adjust their position.
- Context-sensitive argument detection: Automatically detects the arguments inside function calls, blocks of code, and ensures the right argument is selected and modified.
- Support for multiple languages: Works with any language that uses parentheses () or curly braces {} for argument lists or parameter blocks.
- Efficient editing: The extension allows for precise control over parameter reordering, minimizing the need for manual edits.

## Commands

The extension offers two commands:

- _Reorder Arguments to the Left_: Moves the currently selected argument one position to the left.
  - **_Windows/Linux_**: `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left`
  - **_macOS_**: `Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+Left`
- _Reorder Arguments to the Right_: Moves the currently selected argument one position to the right.
  - **_Windows/Linux_**: `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right`
  - **_macOS_**: `Ctrl+Shift+Cmd+Right`

## How It Works

- Argument Extraction: The extension identifies the current argument based on the cursor position and extracts all arguments within the nearest function or block.
- Argument Swapping: Once the arguments are extracted, the extension determines the appropriate direction to move the argument (either left or right) based on the userâ€™s command.
- Update the Document: The arguments are replaced with the new order, and the document is updated in place, making the code modifications seamless and error-free.

## Supported Blocks

- Function Calls: Supports reordering parameters within function calls (i.e., arguments inside parentheses ()).
- Code Blocks: Supports reordering elements within blocks that use curly braces {}, such as objects, arrays, and other structures.

## Example Use Case

Imagine you have the following function call in your code:

```js
foo(1, 2, 3, 4);
```

If you move the second argument to the left, the function call becomes:

```js
foo(2, 1, 3, 4);
```

If you move the third argument to the right, the function call becomes:

```js
foo(2, 1, 4, 3);
```

This allows you to easily adjust the order of parameters without having to manually cut and paste the arguments.

## Installation

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
- Search for Reordering.
- Click Install.

Alternatively, you can install the extension by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), typing ext install reordering, and pressing Enter.
